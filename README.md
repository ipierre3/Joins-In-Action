# JoinsInAction_CS_SQL_Starter

Tech Stack: SQL, MySQL, MySQL Workbench, ERDs, DrawSQL

Project problems and setup directions for the Joins in Action SQL project.

Make sure you have covered enough content to meet the prerequisites before starting on this project!


## PREREQUISITES


1. Basic understanding of SQL queries through SQLBolt and SQL in Action
   1. SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT
   2. WHERE, operators with WHERE, complex expressions using AND, OR, NOT, and NULL
   3. Filtering and sorting (LIMIT, ORDER BY)
   4. Aggregate functions: COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM, GROUP BY
   5. Aliasing (creating a new temporary column with the AS clause)
   6. SQL comments
   7. JOINS


## SETUP

1. Download the `.zip` file for this GitHub repository.
2. Unzip the file on your computer.
3. Open MySQL Workbench and choose your local connection.
4. Go to **File > Open SQL Script** in the top menu of MySQL Workbench.
5. In the window that pops up, choose the `database_creation_seed_file.sql` file from the starter files, then click **Open**.
6. Execute all SQL content within the `database_creation_seed_file.sql` file to create the database and seed the initial data.
7. Refresh your Schemas tab and double click on the `movie_library` database to make the it active schema.
8. Now, go to **File > Open SQL Script** in the top menu of MySQL Workbench once again.
9. In the window that pops up, choose the `joins_in_action_starter.sql` file from the starter files, then click **Open**.
10. You should see the script open in MySQL Workbench with all of the problems written out in SQL comments.
11. Write your queries underneath the problem they relate to, and execute those queries to check that they give you the expected output!



## MAIN STORIES
 
(5 points): As a developer, I want to complete all queries in the Joins in Action project.

(10 points): As a developer, I want to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the movie_library database and its containing tables. Make sure to include a snapshot of this ERD in your GitHub repository.


## END RESULT

The end result of this project will be the SQL script with completed queries as outlined in the walkthrough video, as well as a completed Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) included in the repository.
